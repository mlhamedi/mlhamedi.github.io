        <h2>Senior Theatre Major, Greenville</h2>
        
         <p>I am a senior Theatre major at Bob Jones University. I work as a light technician at Rodehaver and Stage Assistant at Performance Hall. Additionally, I am stage manager for all productions at Rodeheaver.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy working in my major because it's a really great opportunity to gain some practical, real world skills that will benefit my future career in theatre. Outside of work and school, I enjoy being in choir at my local church.
         </p> 
         <p>
            Hobbies include reading, video games, hiking, running, travel, and teaching my cat, Gus, to hold still for photos.
